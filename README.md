# EIS - Landing Page

Landing Page Project

Built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

My last project was built only using HTML and CSS, so this time I was able to learn more about javascript.
Javascript was used to implement links on scroll, create a slideshow of client testimonies, sticky the header on scroll and hide and show the mobile menu when needed.

As with any project there was a lot of research + trial and error with the coding. It was challenging but I enjoyed trying to figure out what worked and what didn't.

I learned:

          Be careful with variable names, make them unique and mean something or say what they do. For example, instead of header, in a function that hides the header maybe name it "hidden_header".

          Keep code as clean as possible, clearly seperate code that covers seperate functionalities.

          Sections and containers are really helpful on a landing page when you want to modify the style.

Goals:

Use more Javascript

Learn Jquery
